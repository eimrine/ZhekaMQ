# ZhekaMQ
What are you able to build with your blocks? Castles and palaces, temples and docks.

# goal
Develop a Linked List data structure named the LMSL (Linked Master/Slave List) but having no written specification yet.
Master chain of Linked List must be totally reliable
Slave channel of Linked List must be flood-proof.

#Greenspoon's tenth rule
Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp

#Zheka's first rule
if you are programming C or Fortran, start from implementing Lisp 1.5 and go Lisp instead of C or Fortran.

# Progress

->actually, i am here<-

1. Having a Double-Linked List data structure with Deque algorithm set

2. argc/argv API of zhekaMQ for pushing and popping values in MQ

3. Support of json datatype

4. Multiple chains in one deque, 2 (alpha and beta) by default

5. Releasing the MQ software

6. License, proper Readme, and anything else for having chance this will be useful to anybody else.
