# ZhekaMQ
What are you able to build with your blocks? Castles and palaces, temples and docks.

# goal
Develop a Linked List data structure named the LMSL (Linked Master/Slave List) but having no written specification yet.
Master chain of Linked List must be totally reliable
Slave channel of Linked List must be flood-proof.

#Greenspoon's tenth rule:
Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp

#Zheka's first rule:
if you are programming C or Fortran, start from implementing Lisp 1.5 and go Lisp instead of C or Fortran.

#Progress:

->actually, i am here<-

working DoLT //not all functions work correctly

DoLT with no loops in push() and pop() //it has a loop! what kind of stupid programmer wrote that?
