What are you able to build with your blocks? Castles and palaces, temples and docks.

# goal
Develop a Linked List data structure named the LMSL (Linked Master/Slave List) but having no written specification yet.
Master chain of Linked List must be totally reliable
Slave channel of Linked List must be flood-proof.

##Greenspoon's tenth rule:
Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp
##Zheka's first rule:
if you are programming C or Fortran, start from implementing Lisp 1.5 and go Lisp instead of C or Fortran.

#Progress:
working LL
-> I am here! <-
LL with no loops in push() and pop()
2 chains in one list
MQ
