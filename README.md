# ZhekaMQ
What are you able to build with your blocks? Castles and palaces, temples and docks.

# goal
But don't give up until true love will find you in the end

# Greenspoon's tenth rule
Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp

# Zheka's first rule
if you are programming C or Fortran, start from implementing Lisp, for example use Janet programming language and go Lisp anywhere except of implementing low-level bindings.

# Progress

1. Having a Double-Linked List data structure with a Deque algorithm set

->I'm here<-

2. argc/argv API of zhekaMQ for pushing and popping values in MQ

3. Support of json datatype

4. Multiple chains in one deque, 2 (alpha and beta) by default

5. Releasing the MQ software

6. License, proper Readme, and anything else for having chance this will be useful to anybody else.
