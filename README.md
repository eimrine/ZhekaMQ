# ZhekaMQ
What are you able to build with your blocks? Castles and palaces, temples and docks.

# goal
Develop a Linked List data structure named the LMSL (Linked Master/Slave List) but having no written specification yet.
Master chain of Linked List must be totally reliable
Slave channel of Linked List must be flood-proof.

#Greenspoon's tenth rule
Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp

#Zheka's first rule
if you are programming C or Fortran, start from implementing Lisp 1.5 and go Lisp instead of C or Fortran.

#Progress

->actually, i am here<-

1. Having a Double-Linked List data structure with Deque algorithm set

2. argc/argv API of zhekaMQ

3. json datatype and utilz

4. Multiple chains in one list, alpha and beta

5. MQ

6. License, proper Readme, and anything else for having chance this will be useful to anybody else.
